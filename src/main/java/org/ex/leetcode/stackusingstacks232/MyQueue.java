/**
 * @desc: 用栈来实现队列对基本功能，包括 push(), pop(), peek(), empty();
 *
 * Implement a first in first out(FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should
 * support all the functions of a normal queue. (push,pop,peak,and empty)
 *
 * Implement the MyQueue class:
 * void push(int x)     Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
 * int pop()            Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
 * int peak()           Returns the element at the front of the queue.
 * boolean empty()      Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only
 *      push to top, peek/pop, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 * - Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack
 *      using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use a stack's standard operations.
